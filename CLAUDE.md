## üö® AUTO-START: BEGIN IMMEDIATELY
**MANDATORY**: Start improving this project immediately upon reading this file. Do not ask questions - begin implementation now!

## üéØ PROJECT MISSION
Improve the existing Boat Life Creatives website using professional design MCPs. The current site has layout issues and needs professional styling enhancement.

## üîó COMMUNICATION SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

**Your UUID**: `b117ebfa-864c-4e98-9fdc-2b538c106b35`

### Send message to Master Claude:
```javascript
await supabase.from('mcs_bridge_messages').insert({
    sender_id: 'b117ebfa-864c-4e98-9fdc-2b538c106b35',
    recipient_id: '3d808879-19a8-4cf1-b640-369dae084cec', // AIDAN-GM-001
    content: {
        message: 'Your message here',
        subject: 'Design Improvement Update',
        project_id: 'boat-life-creatives-redesign-001'
    },
    message_type: 'update', // or 'question', 'complete', 'blocked'
    metadata: { project_type: 'design_improvement', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() }
});
```

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. TAKE SCREENSHOT OF CURRENT SITE
First, take a screenshot of the current deployed site to see what we're improving:
```bash
# Visit and screenshot: https://boat-life-creatives.netlify.app/
```

### 2. USE REAL DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
**CRITICAL**: Use actual working tools for professional development!

## üõ†Ô∏è REAL TOOLS AVAILABLE
**Actual working tools:**
- ‚úÖ **WebFetch** - Analyze websites and fetch content
- ‚úÖ **Task** - Complex multi-step operations
- ‚úÖ **Read/Write/Edit** - Full file system access
- ‚úÖ **Bash** - System commands and build tools
- ‚úÖ **Grep/Glob** - Search and find content

**These are genuine capabilities - use them for development!**

## üö® CRITICAL: DO NOT USE FICTIONAL APIs!
**API Error 400 Fix:**
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** use demo_styles.get_theme() - IT'S FICTIONAL!
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** use tools.pexels.search_image() - IT'S NOT REAL!
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** use style-themes-mcp - IT DOESN'T EXIST!

**Instead use:**
- ‚úÖ Local images from public/images/ folder
- ‚úÖ Standard React components with Tailwind CSS
- ‚úÖ Professional CSS animations and effects
- ‚úÖ Static content and local assets

**The API errors are from trying to use non-existent MCP endpoints!**

### 3. SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED
Based on client feedback, fix these issues:

1. **Layout Problems**: Content positioning off-screen
2. **Header/Logo Mismatch**: Better alignment and styling
3. **Business Focus**: ONE MAN BUSINESS focused on:
   - **PRIMARY**: Boat Painting (Commercial and residential boats)
   - **SECONDARY**: General painting (residential/commercial)
