                I'm a one-man business who's been painting boats and houses around the area for 15 years. 
                No fancy office, no big team - just reliable, quality work at fair prices.
              </p>
              <p className="fade-in">
                Started with boats at the marina, expanded to houses when people kept asking. 
                Same approach for both: turn up on time, do the job properly, leave it tidy.

            <p className="fade-in">
              Started painting boats 15 years ago because I loved being around the water and working with my hands. 
              Turns out I was good at it - really good. Word spread around the marina, then into town.
            </p>
            <p className="fade-in">
              Now I split my time between boats and houses. Same principles apply: proper prep work, quality materials, 
              attention to detail. Whether it's anti-fouling a hull or painting your living room, I treat every job 
              like it's my own.
