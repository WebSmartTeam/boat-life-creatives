      question: "Do you work weekends?",
      answer: "Yes, especially for business jobs. I work around your schedule - evenings, weekends, whatever suits you."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to move furniture?",
      answer: "No, I'll move what needs moving and cover everything else. Dust sheets down, surfaces protected - you shouldn't find paint where it shouldn't be."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does anti-foul take?",
      answer: "Depends on the boat size, but usually 1-3 days. Clean the hull, prep it properly, apply the anti-foul with proper drying time between coats."
    },
    {
      question: "What guarantee do I get?",
      answer: "If the work fails because of something I did wrong, I'll come back and fix it. Fair materials, proper application - that's what you're paying for."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you work around my business?",
      answer: "Absolutely. I do lots of shops and offices overnight or weekends. You open Monday morning and everything's done."
    },
    {
      question: "What paint do you use?",
      answer: "Good stuff. International and Hempel for boats, Dulux and Crown for houses, whatever suits your budget. I'll advise what works best."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you make a mess?",
      answer: "I'm a tidy worker. Dust sheets down, everything protected, clean up as I go. You get your space back ready to use."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you match my existing colour?",
      answer: "Yes, I can match pretty much any colour. Or if you want something different, I'll help you pick something that works."
    },
    {
      question: "What about weather for outside work?",
      answer: "Can't paint in the rain or when it's too cold. I'll check the forecast and let you know if we need to move the dates."
    },
    {
      question: "How much do you charge for quotes?",
      answer: "Nothing. I'll come look at the job, tell you what needs doing, give you a fair price. No obligation."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can you start?",
      answer: "Usually within a week or two, sometimes sooner. Depends what I've got on. Emergency jobs I can often fit in quicker."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you clean your brushes in my sink?",
      answer: "No, I bring my own water container and clean up kit. Your sinks stay clean."
    }
